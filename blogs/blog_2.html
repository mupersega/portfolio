            <h2>What is Venture Debt?</h2>
            <p>Venture debt is a loan to companies that have raised money from venture capital investors (“VCs”). Traditionally, banks only loan money to companies that have collateral (i.e. assets, cash flow, profits); venture debt is different in that venture debt lenders will offer debt financing to promising companies that are not cash flow positive, without existing collateral, provided that these emerging companies have raised money from VCs and show strong growth potential.</p>
            <p>Money is essential for companies to grow, and venture debt can be helpful. It can boost a company’s cash reserves and extend its runway. It can provide a bridge so that a founder can delay raising an equity round, grow the company and attract higher valuations. Venture debt interest rates often are based off of WSJ Prime (currently at an all-time low percentage), and venture debt may protect a founder’s ownership by allowing a founder to retain a higher percentage ownership of his/her company. While venture debt can help a founder by protecting ownership, it also carries risks and founders should understand the pros and cons before accepting venture debt.</p>
            <p>Venture debt investors are fundamentally different from equity investors. Equity investors understand that one successful investment can make up for a number of losses; venture debt investors expect to get repaid on every investment. With venture debt investors, repayment is contractually required: every cent must be repaid. Venture debt investors typically tie their investment to business plan milestones, metrics like accounts receivable and revenue, or events, whereas most equity investors allow startups leeway to pivot. Unlike equity investors, venture debt investors are less flexible. These investors are not as concerned with reputational damage: while an equity investor may support a startup that “pivots” to find product market fit, a venture debt investor is less understanding, given the need to get repaid. Venture debt lenders are thus more apt to enforce a contract to make sure their money is returned, even if the company would be killed from such enforcement. These investors are myopically focused on losing as little money as possible; they rarely are interested in any other considerations.</p>
            <h2>Strategy: How to Approach Venture Debt</h2>
            <p>First, founders need to understand basic venture debt terminology. Founders do not need to be venture debt experts, but do need to understand their contractual obligations, particularly because venture debt lenders will rely on these contractual terms to protect their investment1. Founders need to assess which terms are important, and which ones may place their company at risk. At the bottom of this essay is a short glossary and explanation of some key terms that founders will encounter in a venture debt financing.</p>
            <p>Second, after understanding the basics, founders should consider evaluating multiple venture debt lenders in order to make the process competitive. Far too often, Y Combinator founders tell me that they met a venture debt lender, got a term sheet and quickly signed and agreed to terms. A founder would never speak to only one equity investor when raising a Series A round, but in my experience, it is common for founders to speak to only one venture debt investor. Fortunately, there are more lenders and new entrants offering venture debt, and founders now have additional options (more on this topic below). Working with a more friendly lender that you know well can make all the difference in a downside case, but you also should not drag on the venture debt raise process for months – you have a business to run.</p>
            <p>Third, founders must involve legal counsel when entering into a venture debt relationship. Again, the terms and conditions of venture debt financings arguably matter more than equity financings because lenders do not hesitate to assert their rights and will apply assertive tactics to recover every dollar they can. For example, there are important differences in the types of “defaults” that may trigger a loan to be due immediately, and experienced counsel will help protect a company and make sure that it is better positioned if things go awry. Often a startup involves counsel after a term sheet is signed, but it is better to involve counsel earlier in the process, which typically is when a company has more leverage.</p>
            <p> Please note that while venture debt investors need to protect their investment, they also deserve to be treated fairly. There are many instances where venture lenders have complained that companies were not forthcoming about their circumstances and did not provide relevant information such as their cash burn, or the loss of a significant lost contract. It does not help a company to hide from its lenders – the worst possible way to treat your lender is to make them think that everything is going according to plan, and then drop a bombshell on them when it’s too late to course-correct. Because there may be ways to restructure debt, it inures to a company’s benefit to treat its lenders fairly.</p>
